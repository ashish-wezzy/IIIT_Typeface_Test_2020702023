The datastore should have the following schema:

● API name (string)
● User ID (string)
● Request time (timestamp)
● Response time (integer)
● Response status (success or error)

To perform the sample queries mentioned, the datastore should have the following indexes:
● API name and user ID
● User ID and request time

The first query can be performed by grouping the data by API name and calculating the average
response time for each group. The API with the maximum average response time can then be
returned.

The second query can be performed by grouping the data by user ID and API name, and then
calculating the average response time for each group. The API with the maximum average
response time for each user can then be returned.
The third query can be performed by grouping the data by API name and request time, and then
calculating the error percentage for each group. The error percentage can then be returned in
buckets of 1 hour for 24 hours.


To perform the first query, the following MySQL query can be used:

SELECT api_name, AVG(response_time) as avg_response_time
FROM datastore
GROUP BY api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
LIMIT 1


To perform the second query, the following MySQL query can be used:

SELECT user_id, api_name, AVG(response_time) as avg_response_time
FROM datastore
GROUP BY user_id, api_name
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC


To perform the third query, the following MySQL query can be used:

SELECT api_name, HOUR(request_time) as request_hour, COUNT(CASE WHEN
response_status = 'error' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as error_percentage
FROM datastore
GROUP BY api_name, request_hour
